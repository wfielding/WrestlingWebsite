<h1>Is there a Women's Team?</h1>
<p>Yes we are a co-ed club! During the 2021-22 season we had Michigan's first competitive women's team! As well as our first two women's national qualifiers! We're looking forward to growing the women's side of the team for the 2022-23 season! Please reach out to us at  <a href=" mailto: michiganwrestlingclub@gmail.com">michiganwrestlingclub@gmail.com</a> if you have any questions.</p>
<h1>When/Where is Practice?</h1>
<p>We have the honor of sharing a practice space with Michigan's NCAA D1 team at <a href="https://mgoblue.com/sports/2017/6/16/facilities-wrestling-center-html.aspx">Bahna Wrestling Center</a>, one of the nicest wrestling facilities in the nation. The facility is located on south campus shown in the map below. During the season (October to March), we have practice Monday-Thursday from 6:30pm-8:30pm.  </p>
